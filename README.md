# Numerical-solutions-of-particular-systems-of-linear-equations
The objective of this project is to implement some numerical solutions of particular systems of linear equations: Jacobi, Gauss Sediel and Conjugate gradient method.

The linear equation to solve is of the form *Ax = b* where A is a matrix of the form:
